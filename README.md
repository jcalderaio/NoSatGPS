#Integrated SpatiaLite JavaScript library into the app to assist with 3D map (GIS) interpretation

AutoCAD was used to map out my computer science department and pre-loaded into this app. Can run queries such as:

##SELECT room_number FROM room;

or

##SELECT geometry FROM room;


The result will be a three-dimensional representation in JSON output.
